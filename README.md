# 42KL-CP-Cub3D
Cub3D is an interactive maze exploration project that utilizes ray-casting techniques to create a dynamic first-person view.

Developed in C, the project allows users to navigate through a 3D maze, experiencing real-time rendering and interactive movement.

This project took us two weeks to learn everything about raycasting and to create our Cub3D from scratch.
